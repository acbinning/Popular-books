# Welcome to the popular books repo

As a Dr. of literature, I thought this would be a nice place to start on my individual journey. 

In this repo you'll find a quick data visualisation of a Kaggle dataset. 

I threw this together in a morning with a coffee to get my fingers warmed up and to start adding some content to my bare GitHub.

•• A very quick disclaimer that other books, and particularly, other authors do exist. 

Hope you enjoy!
